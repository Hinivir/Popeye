# Popeye
The goal of the project was to understand <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker et Docker Compose</a> with a project that we will have to create 3 Docker and 1 Docker Compose

## How to launch the project

For launching the project just make 

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

The command will download, build and launch all the Docker with the Docker Compose.
